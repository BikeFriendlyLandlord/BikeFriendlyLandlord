# BikeFriendlyLandlord

Landlords have many tools and services to vet a potential tenant before signing a lease. Tenants often have no way of investgating a landlord before entering an agreement. Furthermore, cyclists and pet owners have an even harder time finding apartments as landlords often discriminte against allowing bikes and pets in their buildings. Bike Friendly Landlord is a landlord review website that sets out to change this. Tenents can search a database of landlords by location and bike and pet friendly-ness and view the landlords ratings and reviews. Tenants can also leave reviews for landlords and give a rating. The application has an authentication feature to manage users rewiews and a map to display building locations.
