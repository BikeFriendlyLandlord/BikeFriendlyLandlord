* add flitering to the map maybe
* edit the ratings in a landlord reviews
* re calculate landlord ratings when deleting a rewiew

* from 'my account' page, reviews arn't assoctianted with ary landlord
* more search parameters to filter landlords (sqft, name, review rating)
* sort results on search page + pagination
